If any of the statements contained in the Proposal or the Acceptance Advice be untrue or incorrect in any respect, this\nPolicy shall be void but Credsure may retain any premium that has been paid.</p>\n<p><b>3 EXERCISING OF CARE</b></p>\n<p>A. It shall be the duty of the Insured to exercise reasonable and usual care, skill, forethought and prudence in granting\ncredit to an Insured Buyer and in particular the Insured shall take into consideration his experience of the Insured Buyer\u2019s account.<br><br>\nB. In the case where information obtained or experience gained concerning a Buyer is not sufficiently favourable to justify\ngranting credit to such Buyer (albeit within the credit limit prescribed in respect of such Buyer) with the judgement of a\nreasonable businessman, the Insured shall inform Credsure of the fact in writing.<br><br>\nC. The Insured shall immediately notify Credsure of any event coming to his notice which is not of general knowledge and\nwhich is likely to cause a Loss in terms of the Policy or which is likely to cause a significant deterioration of the risk or\nrisks covered by this Policy.<br><br>\nD.

Any payments made by an insured Buyer or Recoveries made after a cause of loss has occurred shall be deemed to\nliquidate the outstanding balance and, where part of this outstanding balance is not insured, the payments and amounts\nrecovered shall be deemed to liquidate the Insured and Uninsured outstanding balance pro rata.</p>\n<p><b>12 DECLARATIONS</b></p>\n<p>A. The Insured shall submit monthly declarations to Credsure showing:-<br><br>\n(i) The total of the balances outstanding and arising from deliveries made on or after the date specified in Section 3 of\nthe Schedule on all Insured Buyers on the day specified in Section 11 of the Schedule, such balances reduced to\nthe amounts of the Credit Limits, where in the cases of individual Insured Buyers, the balances owing exceed the\namounts of the respective Credit Limits.\nThe Insured shall be entitled to exclude from the total of the balances which is to be declared, any amounts which\nare unpaid more than three months after the due date (meaning the postponed date where applicable).<br>\n(ii) All amounts covered by this Policy which were not paid on due date (meaning the postponed due date where\napplicable) and have remained unpaid for longer than;<br>\n(a) 15 days in the case of amounts payable against acceptance Bills of Exchange or other negotiable instruments; and<br>\n(b) 60 days in the case of amounts payable in any other manner.<br><br>\nB.

Any costs incurred by Credsure for the purpose of preventing a threatening loss or mitigating an actual loss in terms of\nthis Policy, will be borne by the Insured to the extent of his proportionate interest in such loss. Credsure shall be entitled\nto deduct from any indemnity payable by it any amount outstanding in terms of this Clause. If no indemnity becomes\npayable by Credsure any amounts due to it shall be paid as soon as such fact has been established.<br><br>\nC. Costs referred to under A and B above shall include any legal costs incurred or arising from any proceedings which were\ncommenced but not necessarily concluded before the payment of an indemnity in respect of the Insured Debt concerned.</p>\n<p><b>18 PROTRACTED DEFAULT IN CASES OF DISPUTE</b></p>\n<p>In the event of an Insured Buyer disputing his indebtedness the period of 4 months shall not commence to run for the\npurposes of Protracted Default unless and until an award confirming the indebtedness to the Insured has been made by a\ncourt of law or a court of arbitration in terms of the arbitration procedure agreed upon between the Insured and the Insured\nBuyer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where the Insured Buyer disputes his indebtedness and Credsure is of the opinion that\nthe grounds for such dispute are frivolous, Credsure may at its sole discretion agree that the period of 4 months shall\ncommence to run at an earlier point in time than specified above.</p>\n<p><b>19 OFFERS OF COMPROMISE</b></p>\n<p>The Insured shall forthwith notify Credsure in writing of any offer of compromise or composition whether statutory or\notherwise and whether made to the Insured or to the creditors of an Insured Buyer generally in respect of any Insured Debt\nand the Insured shall give effect to and carry out the instructions of Credsure in respect of such compromise or composition\nand the Insured shall not, without the prior written consent of Credsure.<br><br>\nA Accept or refrain from objecting to or voting against any such compromise or composition.<br><br>\nB Compromise with or agree to the release in whole or in part of any Insured Buyer or any Surety, Guarantor or Security.</p>\n<p><b>20 LODGING OF CLAIMS</b></p>\n<p>Upon the occurrence of a Loss the Insured shall be entitled to make a claim under the Policy in respect of any Insured Debt\nin such form as Credsure shall specify and Credsure shall indemnify the Insured on the basis provided in this Policy within 30 days after the Insured has accepted in writing the basis of settlement proposed by Credsure Such claim shall be considered\nfor settlement:-<br><br>\nA Immediately after Credsure has received confirmation that any one of the events defined in Definition 7A of the Policy has\nhappened; or<br><br>\nB Immediately after Protracted Default as defined in Definition 7B of the Policy has occurred.</p>\n<p><b>21 CESSION OF RIGHTS</b></p>\n<p>Contemporaneously with and as a condition precedent to payment of a claim by Credsure to the Insured, the Insured\nshall if so required by Credsure:-<br><br>\nA Cede and transfer to Credsure his rights under the contract(s) to which the claim relates and/or all his rights in or\nunder any guarantees, suretyships or securities in respect of the Insured Debt.<br><br>\nB Deliver up to Credsure any goods in respect of which such payment has been made and any documents relating\nthereto and cede and transfer to Credsure his rights and interest in any such goods and documents.</p>\n<p><b>22 COLLECTION OF SALVAGE</b></p>\n<p>After payment of a claim by Credsure the Insured shall if so required by Credsure take all steps, including the institution\nof proceedings, to effect recoveries whether from the Insured Buyer or from any Guarantor and/or other person from\nwhom such recoveries may be made.
