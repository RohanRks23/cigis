However, if you already have an established external debt collector, you may hand over to them and advise\nCREDSURE accordingly.</p>\n<p>Proviso 12D is a reminder to policy holders that failure to comply with the proviso may lead to repudiation of claims,\nand hence the importance that CREDSURE attaches to this proviso and our added effort to ensure that all the policy holders\nunderstand and comply with the proviso.</p>\n<p>Please be reminded that once CREDSURE has paid a claim, the debtor is pursued for the 100% recovery of the debt and\nany amounts recovered are shared with CREDSURE according to the claims sharing ratio.</p>\n<p>Should you need any clarification regarding this proviso, please do not hesitate to contact us at 3188015.</p>\n<br><br>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rated BBB+ by Global Credit Rating(\"GCR\")\n</p>\n<br>\n<p>a BDC Subsidiary | Directors: K.H.
